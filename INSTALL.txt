Woven assumes you have Django already installed. And you are using pip right?

    ``pip install woven``

.. Note::
    
    Woven is currently not strictly compatible with Django 1.3 alpha while contrib.staticfiles is still begin finalized.    

You may also want to install the following recommended packages::

    pip install south
    
To use woven add ``woven`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``
