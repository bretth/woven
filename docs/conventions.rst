Conventions 
===========

Woven will use the following conventions to layout your project on the target host.

In the following examples we are deploying a project ``example_project`` to a site ``example.com``

Apache & Nginx Configuration files
----------------------------------

/etc/apache2/sites-available/
By convention the configuration file will be saved using the domain name as follows.

/etc/apache2/sites-available/example_com-0.1.conf

Nginx for media is done the same way

Project Deployment Layout
-------------------------

Within the root folder are the following::

   ~/.package_cache (Pip will cache packages here)
   ~/.staging (all rsynced files are staged here before copying to final destination for network efficiency)
   ~/--database (for sqlite if it is used)
    |   |--example_project.db (will always be deployed as the [project-name].db)
    |--env (The root directory for all virtual environments)
        |--example_project (symlink to the current virtualenv version)
        |--example_project-0.1 (The virtualenv root for this version)
            |--bin
            |--dist
                 |--requirements.pybundle
            |--include 
            |--lib
            |--project
                |--example_project (package directory - symlinked to site-packages)
                    |--manage.py (your development manage.py)
                    |--settings.py (global & dev specific settings)
                    |--sitesettings (site local setting files)
                            |--__init__.py 
                            |--example_com.py (site local settings)
                            |--manage.py (you run this on the node)
                            |--settings.py (primary settings file for nodes)
            |--templates (your project templates go here)
            |--static (admin and other app media)
            |--wsgi (web server scripts go here including modwsgi python file)
                 |--example_com.py
       |--example_project-0.2 (next release version - as above)
    ...
    |--log (symlinks to /var/log)
    | Another media directory for files that in the user domain (MEDIA_URL) rather than required for the application
    | These would normally be hosted on something like s3, but you may want to host it locally
    |--public  (for single domain deployments any project media goes here if you are hosting media locally)
    |--src (pip will store any source repositories here)

Server-side State
---------------------

Woven keeps track of server state and other housekeeping functions using the

`/var/local/woven/` directory

Currently state is stored as a filename with or without content. This may change.

Client-side state
--------------------

Woven keeps track of the initial setup of your node (host) using a client side file.
A .woven folder is created in the project directory and a file with the name of the host is created.

This behaviour will be deprecated when http://code.fabfile.org/issues/show/189 is implemented.
